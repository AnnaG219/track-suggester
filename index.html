      <h1>What Programming Is For You?</h1>

      <p>Are you a student learning how to code or program? Are you coming closer to the point where you have to choose which programming language to learn? (Well at least to learn first, you'll have opportunities throughout your entire career to learn different languages if you so choose.) But initally you'll have to pick one language up to start on, and shouldn't you pick the track that encompasses the aspects that interest you? You have to consider what kind of programs you want to be writing, or even what kind of business enviroment your imagining yourself working in? Take a few minutes to answer these carefully thought out questions and  and by the end we'll suggest which track might be the best for you to pursue!</p>

          <h2>Fantastic!</h2>
          <p> It looks like <strong>C#</strong> is the language for you to learn!
             C# is very popular with bigger companies, especially Microsoft considering
             they wrote C# in 2001. Often used for building internal software this language
             is also strongly and statically typed and is the backing of Microsoft.
              C# is also one of the most <em>in demand languages on the market.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div id="choice2">
          <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
          <p> It seems like <strong>Java</strong> is the language you might me the
            most inclined to start learning! Java is used anywhere from high-preformance processing
            to building Android User interfaces. That's right, Android. Java is a cross platform
            meaning it is just as easily used for smartphone apps as it is desktop apps. Used mainly by enterprise companies <strong>Java is the most popular of all the languages.</strong>

          <h2>Amazing!</h2>
          <p><strong>So Ruby it is! Which inevitably means Rails as well, the favorite language of
            building interactive web applications.</strong> This is by far one of the easier languages
            to read, and is commonly used to increase productivity. Ruby is involved in almost
             everything involving creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with
             dynamic content. Due to the fact that Ruby simplified many common tasks involved with
              building web applications.</p>

        <div id="choice4">
          <h2>Lucky you!</h2>
          <p>It seems that PHP will be the language best suited to what your looking

            known for its uses in content management systems. ie Wordpress, Drupal, & Joomla.
            Primarily open source for web development, 80% of all sites today use PHP 'server side'.
            A versatile language, you are bound to have diverse employment options. Due to the
            fast paced nature that goes along with PHP you'll most likely be concerned with
            building sites for Brands, businesses or organizations.</p>

          <p>It seems you are interested in the Front End language HTMl and CSS, dealing with the
            <strong>design aspect of web pages, what the user is actually interacting with!</strong> This is a
