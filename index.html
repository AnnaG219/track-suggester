      <h1>What Programming Is For You?</h1>

      <p>Are you a student learning how to code or program? Are you coming closer to the point where you have to choose which programming language to learn? (Well at least to learn first, you'll have opportunities throughout your entire career to learn different languages if you so choose.) But initally you'll have to pick one language up to start on, and shouldn't you pick the track that encompasses the aspects that interest you? You have to consider what kind of programs you want to be writing, or even what kind of business enviroment your imagining yourself working in? Take a few minutes to answer these carefully thought out questions and  and by the end we'll suggest which track might be the best for you to pursue!</p>
